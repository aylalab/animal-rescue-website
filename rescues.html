      <h2 class="pad-t-2 tenamega text-center">Hello, I'm Mali!</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push" src="images/mai.png" alt="">
      <p class="gutter">Mali is a very active dog that requires a lot of exercise. She needs another playful dog in the home to play with and keep her active. She is a Shepherd, please read up on the breed before applying. She is an incredibly sweet girl that would be someone’s best friend in a heart beat. She will need someone who will give her a job and will be extremely active with her. Mali is not suitable for an apartment setting and would do best in a house with a fenced yard.</p>

      <h2 class="pad-t-2 tenamega text-center">Hello, I'm Mindy!</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push" src="images/mindy.png" alt="">
      <p class="gutter">Mindy loves to snuggle and go on short walks. She has some separation anxiety so she gets agitated when she is left alone. She will bark for a short while and settle down afterwards. She loves being close to people and will follow you everywhere. She is very food motivated and will stay close to you while you cook and eat. She can be vocal at times but will quickly settle down with a “no barking” command.</p>

      <h2 class="pad-t-2 tenamega text-center">Hello, I'm Gus!</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push gutter" src="images/gus.png" alt="">
      <p class="gutter">Gus is smart and very food motivated. He is very sweet, loves to be pet and cuddled (one he gets to know you). He is still young, big and really strong and needs to learn his manners. He gets very excited and mouths. He loves going on walks, and needs a family committed to training him. If there is another dog in the home, they would have to have a similar “rough house” style of play — this type of lay makes him unsuitable for a home with young children. He loves toys and loves to destroy them even more!</p>

      <h2 class="pad-t-2 tenamega text-center">Hello, I'm Mickey!</h2>
      <img class="img-flex push gutter" src="images/mickey.png" alt="">
      <p class="gutter">Meet Mickey, your new singing and dancing partner! Mickey’s ideal owners will be someone who is very savvy with dog body language as understanding this is key to Mickey being the best dog he can be. Sometimes Mickey can display behaviours which may make him look aggressive to the unsuspecting person, but really he just wants some attention as he looooves attention (the big suck). Mickey is a big snuggler and does enjoy spending time with other dogs, as long as they are respectful, of course. Sometimes Mickey can get a little excited with other dogs around which is not always welcome, but this is easily managed with a confident owner. When Mickey is in a bit of a grump, he finds comfort in his covered crate and easily settles himself down.</p>

      <img class="img-flex push gutter" src="images/luna.png" alt="">
      <p class="gutter">Luna is a sweet girl who would love a playful doggy sibling and a backyard to play in! Ideally we are looking for someone to continue working on her reactivity; she is a quick learner and very food motivated. She would do best in a home with no small children or small animals.</p>
